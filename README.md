# Screeps

My try on Screeps TypeScript
It's a total mess I know.
Don't judge me and my 7% of knowledge of what I'm actually doing...

(Now with working autospawning.. oops..)

#### Next:
- [ ] Towers
  - [ ] Defend
  - [ ] Heal Creeps
  - [ ] Repair Structures
- [ ] Wall Repairing
- [ ] Mulit Rooming setup (reserver and claimer creep)

##### Note:
Lodash is not exporting correctly. The functions are replaced with undefined. They need to be changed manually after compiling in the main.js file.
